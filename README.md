# Kickstarter Crowdfunding Data Analysis
Data analysis on Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns. Analyzing a dataset consisting of 4,114 Kickstarter crowdfunding projects. 

### Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the projectâ€™s initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this project the main goal will be to organize and analyze a database of 4,114 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

### Questions to Consider 
1. What category (and Sub-category) has had the most successful campaigns? 
2. What country has the most successful campaigns? 
3. How many campaigns come from each country?
4. How quickly do these campaigns get funded?
5. Does being a 'staff-pick' campaign influence success?
6. On average, how many backers does it take for these campaigns to be successful?
7. Is there any variance between country and the amount of backers?
8. What categories do countries use the most?
9. Finally, keep and open mind and let's see what else the data will show aside from these questions!
